# Food-website
Project assignment for Web Tech

The purpose of this project was to gain an understanding of how to develop websites and avoid the common pitfalls inexperienced developers might come across.

This is my first website so my learning focus was to get the core languages required to create a fully functional website. This included the following technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jquery, Gimp (PNG), inkscape (SVG).
